# 6x11 keypad PCB

A 6x11 matrix keypad, designed for the reference grblPANEL implementation.

Each of the six rows has provision for ten 12x12mm through hole momentary tactile switches, and one 3.5mm screw terminal header for for panel mount or encoder switch inputs.

Each switch position has a series diode to prevent ghosting. Switch postions would be populated to suit the chosen front panel layout & keypad map.

Connection back to the main PCB is made through a 2x10 IDC header.
